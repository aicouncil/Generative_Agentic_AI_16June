# ðŸ§  Generative AI with GPT for Image Generation

> **Summary:**  
This notebook demonstrates how to use OpenAI's GPT capabilities to generate images using prompts.  
It explores basic setup, image generation through API calls, and visualization techniques.


```python
!pip install openai
```

## ðŸ“š Table of Contents


### ðŸ§  Explanation:
- This installs the `openai` Python package which provides access to OpenAI APIs.
- Ensure it's run only once in your environment (Colab, Jupyter, etc.).
- Other dependencies like `httpx`, `pydantic`, and `tqdm` come along with it.

**Output:**

```python
import openai
from IPython.display import Image,display
import requests
```

### ðŸ§  Explanation:
- This imports the necessary libraries:
  - `openai` for using the OpenAI API
  - `IPython.display.Image` and `display` to render images inside the notebook
  - `requests` for making HTTP requests (e.g., downloading generated images)


```python
import os
from google.colab import userdata
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = userdata.get('o_key')

client = openai.OpenAI(
    api_key = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")
    )

#Generate the image
reponse = client.images.generate(
    model = "dall-e-3",
    prompt = "A boy driving a futristic flying car",
    n = 1,
    size = "1024x1024",
    quality = "standard",
)

image_url = reponse.data[0].url
```

### ðŸ§  Explanation:
- This code segment performs core functionality in the workflow. (Details added in the next parsing loop)


```python
display(Image(url = image_url))
```

client = openai.OpenAI(
    api_key = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")
    )

def generate_image(prompt):
  reponse = client.images.generate(
      model = "dall-e-3",
      prompt = "A boy driving a futristic flying car",
      n = 1,
      size = "1024x1024",

  )
  return reponse.data[0].url


import gradio as gr

gr.Interface(fn=generate_image , inputs="text" , outputs="image" , title="Image Generator").launch()
```

### ðŸ§  Explanation:
- This imports the necessary libraries:
  - `openai` for using the OpenAI API
  - `IPython.display.Image` and `display` to render images inside the notebook
  - `requests` for making HTTP requests (e.g., downloading generated images)

**Output:**


```
It looks like you are running Gradio on a hosted a Jupyter notebook. For the Gradio app to work, sharing must be enabled. Automatically setting `share=True` (you can turn this off by setting `share=False` in `launch()` explicitly).

Colab notebook detected. To show errors in colab notebook, set debug=True in launch()
* Running on public URL: https://1210c4621fc36d8c8a.gradio.live

This share link expires in 1 week. For free permanent hosting and GPU upgrades, run `gradio deploy` from the terminal in the working directory to deploy to Hugging Face Spaces (https://huggingface.co/spaces)
