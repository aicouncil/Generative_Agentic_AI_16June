I want 3 agents, The first agent should search the internet using google custom search and collect information, such as where a person worked, what a person doing now, 
in what project the person is working currently where a place exists, what are places to visit, real time price of products, real time news etc. 
The entire web should be searched, including Github, X(formerly twitter), wikipedia snd more.  

The second agent writes a complete description about the subject. 

The third agent then create a personalised mail to the person if it is about the person to compliment 
him and ask for any oppurtunity if he or she has. it can create a detailed report if it is about somethong else and create a mail. Role based prompting can be good.
