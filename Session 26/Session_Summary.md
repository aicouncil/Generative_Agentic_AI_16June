The meeting on August 6, 2025, between Pritam Kusiyait and the AI Council, focused on the implementation and customization of an agent-based system for information retrieval and personalized communication.

Here's a summary of the key discussion points:

  * **System Functionality:** The core of the discussion was an agent-based system designed to perform web research and create personalized emails. This system uses a supervisor-worker architecture with integrated web search tools.
  * **Google Custom Search Integration:** Pritam Kusiyait suggested, and the AI Council confirmed, the use of Google Custom Search as a third-party API for web search. They resolved an issue related to the "programmable search engine ID" by creating a custom search engine.
  * **Agent Roles and Prompts:** The system consists of three agents:
      * A "comprehensive web researcher" that uses Google Custom Search to gather information on people, places, or products.
      * A "description writer" that crafts detailed descriptions of the subject.
      * A "personalized communicator" that composes personalized emails (for people) or detailed reports (for non-persons).
        The importance of "prompt engineering" to tailor these agents' behavior was emphasized.
  * **Local Output and Customization:** A "write tool" was integrated to save the generated output (reports and emails) locally. The AI Council demonstrated how to modify prompts to ensure local saving and successfully showed the system searching for "Ellen Musk" and generating a report and email. They also showed how to customize the shared chatbot's appearance and remove the "powered by" text.
  * **Real Estate Use Case:** Pritam Kusiyait proposed using the system to scrape real estate agent details from websites like Zillow.com for business outreach (e.g., offering website development services). The AI Council confirmed the system's capability to perform such targeted web searches.
  * **Learning and Adaptability:** The AI Council shared that learning these AI concepts took a few months due to a corporate training request. They stressed the rapid evolution of the AI field, noting that many tools become obsolete quickly.
  * **Future Implementations:** Pritam Kusiyait expressed interest in deploying the AI agent to cloud services like AWS and integrating AI into platforms like Slack and SharePoint. The AI Council confirmed the feasibility of developing these functionalities, including voice agents, within the existing flow.

**Suggested next steps:**

  * AI Council will instruct Pritam Kusiyait on deploying the web interface to the cloud in an upcoming class.
  * Pritam Kusiyait will verify that the text file is generated in the specified folder.
  * Pritam Kusiyait will rename the generated MD file to TXT.
