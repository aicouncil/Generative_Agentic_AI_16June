Detailed Explanation of llama_chat_app.py
This file is a Streamlit web application that allows users to interact with a local LLama 3 language model. The app sends user prompts to the model and displays the generated responses.

1. Imports
```
import streamlit as st
import requests
import json
```
streamlit: Used for building the web interface.
requests: For making HTTP requests to the LLama model server.
json: For parsing JSON responses.

2. App Title
```
st.title("Chat with LLama 3 (An offline AI app)")
```

Sets the title of the web app.
3. User Input
```
user_prompt = st.text_area("Enter ypur prompt" , height=150)
```

Displays a text area for the user to enter their prompt.
The height is set to 150 pixels.
4. Function: ask_llama
```
def ask_llama(prompt , model = 'llama3.1:8b' , host = 'http://127.0.0.1:11434/'):
    response = requests.post(
        f"{host}/api/generate",
        json = {"model" : model , "prompt" : prompt}
    )

    full_response = ""
    for line in response.iter_lines():
        data = json.loads(line.decode("utf-8"))
        full_response += data["response"]

    return full_response.strip()
```

Purpose
Sends the user's prompt to the LLama model server.
Receives and aggregates the model's response.
Parameters
prompt: The user's input.
model: The model name (default: 'llama3.1:8b').
host: The server address (default: 'http://127.0.0.1:11434/').
How It Works
POST Request: Sends a POST request to the LLama server's /api/generate endpoint with the prompt and model name.
Streaming Response: The server responds with lines of JSON, each containing a part of the generated text.
Aggregation: Each line is decoded and parsed, and the "response" field is appended to full_response.
Return: The complete response is returned after stripping whitespace.
Example
Suppose the user enters:
"What is the capital of France?"
The function sends this prompt to the LLama server.
The server responds with JSON lines like:

```
{"response": "The capital of France is Paris."}
```

The function aggregates and returns:
"The capital of France is Paris."
5. Button and Output
```
if st.button("Generate..."):
    if user_prompt:
        llama_response = ask_llama(user_prompt)
        st.markdown(llama_response)
```
Button: Displays a "Generate..." button.
On Click:
If the user has entered a prompt, it calls ask_llama with the prompt.
The response from LLama is displayed using st.markdown.
How the App Works (Step-by-Step Example)
User opens the app: Sees the title and a text area.
User enters a prompt:
Example: "Tell me a joke."
User clicks "Generate...".
App sends the prompt to LLama using ask_llama.
LLama server responds with generated text.
App displays the response in markdown format.
Summary
This app provides a simple chat interface to a local LLama 3 model.
It uses Streamlit for the UI and communicates with the model via HTTP requests.
The response is streamed and displayed to the user.
Note:

The LLama server must be running locally at http://127.0.0.1:11434/.
The model name and server address can be changed as needed.
