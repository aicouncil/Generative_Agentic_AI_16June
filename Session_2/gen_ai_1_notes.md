# Description of `gen_ai_1(transformer).ipynb`

This notebook demonstrates the basics of using Hugging Face's `transformers` library for text generation with the GPT-2 model. It provides a practical walkthrough of generating text completions based on a prompt and explains key generation parameters in accessible terms.

---

## Main Steps Covered

1. **Install and Import Transformers**
   - Installs the `transformers` library (if not already present).
   - Imports the core pipeline interface from `transformers`.

2. **Initialize Text Generation Pipeline**
   - Loads the GPT-2 model through the `pipeline("text-generation", model="gpt2")`.

3. **Generate Text**
   - Defines a text prompt:  
     `"In the future, artificial intelligence will"`
   - Runs the generation pipeline with several important parameters:
     - `max_length=50`: Maximum number of tokens in the output.
     - `num_return_sequences=2`: Generates two different completion variations for the same prompt.
     - `do_sample=True`: Enables randomness in word selection.
     - `top_k=50`: Considers only the top 50 most probable next words.
     - `top_p=0.95`: Uses nucleus sampling to include words whose cumulative probability is 95%.
     - `temperature=0.9`: Adjusts randomness in generation.
     - `eos_token_id=50256`: Special token indicating the end of a sequence for GPT-2.

4. **Display Results**
   - Prints both generated text completions for review and comparison.

5. **Parameter Explanations**
   - The notebook includes a detailed markdown cell that explains the meaning and effects of each key parameter used in the text generation pipeline, such as `eos_token_id`, `do_sample`, `top_k`, `top_p`, `temperature`, and `num_return_sequences`.
