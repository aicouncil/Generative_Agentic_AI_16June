# Topics Covered in Jupyter Notebooks

This document outlines the topics typically covered from top to bottom in Jupyter Notebook files within this repository, providing detailed examples and explanations to guide understanding and practical application.

---

## 1. **Environment Setup**

### Description
The first section usually covers installing and importing the necessary packages.

### Example
```python
!pip install langchain-community faiss-cpu pymupdf
import os
import fitz  # PyMuPDF
import openai
```
**Explanation:**  
This ensures that all dependencies are available in the notebook environment and sets the foundation for further operations.

---

## 2. **API Key Configuration**

### Description
Configuring the API key for services like OpenAI or other cloud providers.

### Example
```python
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your_api_key_here"
```
**Explanation:**  
Storing the API key securely in the environment allows the notebook to access external services without hard-coding sensitive information.

---

## 3. **Document Loading and Text Extraction**

### Description
Functions to upload and extract text from various document formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT).

### Example
```python
def load_pdf(pdf_path):
    doc = fitz.open(pdf_path)
    text = ""
    for page in doc:
        text += page.get_text()
    return text
```
**Explanation:**  
This function reads each page of a PDF and concatenates the text, preparing the data for further processing.

---

## 4. **Text Preprocessing and Chunking**

### Description
Splitting large texts into smaller, manageable chunks for downstream processing (e.g., embedding or search).

### Example
```python
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=50)
chunks = splitter.split_text(text)
```
**Explanation:**  
Chunking ensures that the text can be processed efficiently, especially for models with input size limits.

---

## 5. **Embedding and Vector Storage**

### Description
Generating embeddings for each text chunk and storing them in a vector database for semantic search.

### Example
```python
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vector_db = FAISS.from_texts(chunks, embeddings)
```
**Explanation:**  
Embeddings convert text into numerical vectors, which can then be stored and retrieved based on similarity, enabling semantic search capabilities.

---

## 6. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline Setup**

### Description
Combining the retriever (vector database) and a language model (e.g., GPT) to answer user questions based on uploaded documents.

### Example
```python
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA

qa_pipeline = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=OpenAI(),
    retriever=vector_db.as_retriever(),
    return_source_documents=True
)
```
**Explanation:**  
This pipeline retrieves relevant document chunks and uses a language model to generate a final answer, improving the accuracy of responses.

---

## 7. **User Interface (Gradio Integration)**

### Description
Building an interactive UI for document upload and question answering using Gradio.

### Example
```python
import gradio as gr

def answer_question(query):
    return qa_pipeline({"query": query})["result"]

gr.Interface(fn=answer_question, inputs="text", outputs="text").launch()
```
**Explanation:**  
Gradio provides a simple way to build web-based interfaces, making it easy for users to interact with the RAG system.

---

## 8. **Advanced Features: Multi-File Support & Source Attribution**

### Description
Supporting multiple document types and providing references to source documents in responses.

### Example
```python
def process_files(files):
    # Load and chunk each file, then aggregate into the vector store
    pass

def answer_with_sources(query):
    result = qa_pipeline({"query": query})
    return result["result"], result["source_documents"]
```
**Explanation:**  
Allowing uploads of multiple files (PDF, DOCX, TXT) expands the use cases, while source attribution helps users verify answers.

---

## 9. **Assignment and Practice Section**

### Description
Providing exercises or assignments for users to try out the system themselves.

### Example
```
### Assignment
Create an RAG app that supports multiple file types and displays source documents for each answer.
```
**Explanation:**  
Assignments encourage hands-on practice and reinforce learning.

## Summary

The notebooks are structured to guide users from environment setup, through document processing and semantic search, to building interactive applications. Each topic is illustrated with code examples and explanations, ensuring clarity and practical understanding.
